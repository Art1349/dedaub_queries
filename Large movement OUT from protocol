-- Large amount, in all tokens together, drained from a protocol in a single tx. 
-- Query applies to all protocols defined in the system. Note that the definition of a protocol 
-- is often heuristic, so the draining may not always match expectations. E.g., taking ETH out of
-- the WETH contract will appear as taking money out of the Maker protocol. (Filtered this out
-- explicitly.) Still, the results of 
-- this query should be inspected, as they likely represent large fund movements outside a certain 
-- circle of trust. Currently setting the query to run as an alert, every few mins, and over the last
-- hour's worth of transactions.
